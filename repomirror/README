This project will let you mirror a Linux distribution's repository/repositories (or BSD, etc.).

Features:
- Logging
- RSync or FTP supported (RSync mirrors require rsync to be installed and in the $PATH environment variable) (HTTP/HTTPS cannot and will not be supported as there's no real way to do it reliably and efficiently.)
- Locking - prevent a specific distribution from syncing if it is currently being synced but allow other distributions to sync
- Customizable rsync arguments
- Changing of directory/file ownership per-distribution
- Mount-checking per-distribution - a distribution will be skipped if its designated mountpoint is not mounted
- Synchronization checks - timestamp files can be read and written and are used to determine if a sync should take place or not
-- TODO: customizable "staleness" of repos (e.g. sync if timestamp X is older than timestamp Y on server)

See example.config.xml for more information.
