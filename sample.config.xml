      If not provided, don't update a file (NOT recommended!).
      It may or may not be optional; check with the spec for mirroring for the specified distro.
      If the timeFormat attribute is provided, write the timestamp format in the specified format.

      The default is to use a regular UNIX Epoch integer (e.g. June 13, 2020 5:03:53 PM UTC => 1592067833).
      This can be manually specified by the special string "UNIX_EPOCH".
      Optionally, you can use the special string "MICROSECOND_EPOCH", which will specify the above with left-padded
      microseconds (e.g. June 13, 2020 5:09:13.995777 PM UTC => 1592068153.995777).

        If you need to find a mirror, you may be interested in the utils/find_fastest_upstream/ scripts. They will
        automatically find (and sort based on connection speed) all mirrors in your country for a given distro.
        They can even generate stubbed configuration files using those upstreams.
        Currently only Arch Linux and CentOS are supported.
